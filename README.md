# MGS Import .NET Tool
MINT is a CLI archive manipulation and model / texture conversion program for Metal Gear Solid.

## Usage
The program uses autogenerated commandline parsing, so until I get a proper readme done you can just run `MetalMintSolid.exe` in CMD / Powershell and look at the output.

In general you want to extract `stage.mgz` in your game directory (it's just a regular .zip file so any standard tool will do), and then unpack the DAR achives inside.

For reference the main snake model is located in `init_jim` with textures being in `res_tex1.dar` and models in `res_mdl1.dar`.
